class SpikingNetBase(nn.Module):
    r"""Implement a base class for spiking neural networks

    Spiking neural networks take a tensor of must run over a number of
    time steps. In order to simplify the creation of arbitrary spiking
    neural networks, a `SpikingNet` module takes

    SpikingNet-derived modules take inputs with the shape `(Nbatch, Nsteps, *Ndims)`,
    where `Nsteps` is the length of the input spike train and `Ndims` can
    comprise an arbitrary number of dimensions. 
    
    Modules inheriting from `SpikingNet` must implement a number of properties
    and class methods:

    - They should explicitly define the number of output classes `Nout`.
    - They should implement a `single_pass` method, which is the equiva
      a single pass . This method should
      take two arguments: the input

    For each element in the input sequence, each layer computes the following
    function:

    .. math::
        h_t = \tanh(x_t W_{ih}^T + b_{ih} + h_{t-1}W_{hh}^T + b_{hh})

    where :math:`h_t` is the hidden state at time `t`, :math:`x_t` is
    the input at time `t`, and :math:`h_{(t-1)}` is the hidden state of the
    previous layer at time `t-1` or the initial hidden state at time `0`.
    If :attr:`nonlinearity` is ``'relu'``, then :math:`\text{ReLU}` is used instead of :math:`\tanh`.

    Args:
        input_size: The number of expected features in the input `x`
        hidden_size: The number of features in the hidden state `h`
        num_layers: Number of recurrent layers. E.g., setting ``num_layers=2``
            would mean stacking two RNNs together to form a `stacked RNN`,
            with the second RNN taking in outputs of the first RNN and
            computing the final results. Default: 1
        nonlinearity: The non-linearity to use. Can be either ``'tanh'`` or ``'relu'``. Default: ``'tanh'``
        bias: If ``False``, then the layer does not use bias weights `b_ih` and `b_hh`.
            Default: ``True``
        batch_first: If ``True``, then the input and output tensors are provided
            as `(batch, seq, feature)` instead of `(seq, batch, feature)`.
            Note that this does not apply to hidden or cell states. See the
            Inputs/Outputs sections below for details.  Default: ``False``
        dropout: If non-zero, introduces a `Dropout` layer on the outputs of each
            RNN layer except the last layer, with dropout probability equal to
            :attr:`dropout`. Default: 0
        bidirectional: If ``True``, becomes a bidirectional RNN. Default: ``False``

    Inputs: input, h_0
        * **input**: tensor of shape :math:`(L, H_{in})` for unbatched input,
          :math:`(L, N, H_{in})` when ``batch_first=False`` or
          :math:`(N, L, H_{in})` when ``batch_first=True`` containing the features of
          the input sequence.  The input can also be a packed variable length sequence.
          See :func:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence` or
          :func:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_sequence` for details.
        * **h_0**: tensor of shape :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, H_{out})` for unbatched input or
          :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, N, H_{out})` containing the initial hidden
          state for the input sequence batch. Defaults to zeros if not provided.

        where:

        .. math::
            \begin{aligned}
                N ={} & \text{batch size} \\
                L ={} & \text{sequence length} \\
                D ={} & 2 \text{ if bidirectional=True otherwise } 1 \\
                H_{in} ={} & \text{input\_size} \\
                H_{out} ={} & \text{hidden\_size}
            \end{aligned}

    Outputs: output, h_n
        * **output**: tensor of shape :math:`(L, D * H_{out})` for unbatched input,
          :math:`(L, N, D * H_{out})` when ``batch_first=False`` or
          :math:`(N, L, D * H_{out})` when ``batch_first=True`` containing the output features
          `(h_t)` from the last layer of the RNN, for each `t`. If a
          :class:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.PackedSequence` has been given as the input, the output
          will also be a packed sequence.
        * **h_n**: tensor of shape :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, H_{out})` for unbatched input or
          :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, N, H_{out})` containing the final hidden state
          for each element in the batch.

    Attributes:
        weight_ih_l[k]: the learnable input-hidden weights of the k-th layer,
            of shape `(hidden_size, input_size)` for `k = 0`. Otherwise, the shape is
            `(hidden_size, num_directions * hidden_size)`
        weight_hh_l[k]: the learnable hidden-hidden weights of the k-th layer,
            of shape `(hidden_size, hidden_size)`
        bias_ih_l[k]: the learnable input-hidden bias of the k-th layer,
            of shape `(hidden_size)`
        bias_hh_l[k]: the learnable hidden-hidden bias of the k-th layer,
            of shape `(hidden_size)`

    .. note::
        All the weights and biases are initialized from :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})`
        where :math:`k = \frac{1}{\text{hidden\_size}}`

    .. note::
        For bidirectional RNNs, forward and backward are directions 0 and 1 respectively.
        Example of splitting the output layers when ``batch_first=False``:
        ``output.view(seq_len, batch, num_directions, hidden_size)``.

    .. note::
        ``batch_first`` argument is ignored for unbatched inputs.
